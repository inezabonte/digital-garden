# About My Garden ðŸŒ±

Welcome to my Digital Garden. This is an extension of [my portfolio](https://ineza.codes/).
The idea of a digital garden came after realising that I had no place to store useful information.

I wanted a website where I could;

- Write my thoughts or discoveries that are related to my coding journey.
- Save useful links/bookmarks that I (or someone else) might require at a later time
- Save useful tools I've come across in case I ever forget them
- Write documentation about the projects I've worked on.

My first step was opening [issue #122](https://github.com/inezabonte/inezabonte/issues/122) on my
portfolio's repo as I began researching on how I would make it possible.

My aim was to worry less about the look of the site but more about the content.
I first came across [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). I had no idea what it was used for,
I later came to learn it's used mostly to develop design systems and building components in an isolated
environment, which is far from what I'm trying to achieve.

After searching I came across [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) and [docz](https://www.docz.site/).
They are both static site generators that use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the content which is a plus.
The difference between the two is that Nextra is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) while docz
is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Docz having been around longer has the advantage
of being well known with more users and more features as well.
I however chose Nextra because I had been building with Next.js for a while and wasn't willing to
let it go just yet in addition to Nextra's simple look and easiness to setup.

A few weeks of using Nextra and I was beginning to see some downsides. One of them being that it was difficult to add
my own styles since I was using a predefined theme and changing styles would mean that I'd have to fork,
edit and publish the theme library which is quite a lot of work. Another downside was that
I wasn't able to create dynamic pages since page files were in Markdown.

I eventually decided to do away with Nextra and redesign the whole garden from scratch (with Next.js and
TailWindCSS ofcourse ðŸ˜‰) so as to have more control on how my garden looks.

Feel free to have a look around. Hope it inspires you to make something of your own ðŸ˜Š
