## Avoid filler words in links

When creating links avoid using filler words like "Here" or "Read More". Instead put the most meaningful piece of text into the link .e.g "our guide to web performance"

This helps out screen readers that create shortcuts of all links on a page. When links are filled with repetitive filler text they become less helpful.
