## Add labels to repeated buttons for screen readers

For buttons which are repeated on a page it's best to add a visually hidden label inside the button that explains more about the button and what action it performs to enable those using screen readers to be able to tell them apart.

_Example_

```html
<button>Add to Cart <span class="sr-only">, PRODUCT_NAME</span></button>
```

It's best to add the label as the last item in the button
