## Fetching api data from getStaticProps & getStaticPaths

`getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` are Next.js functions used to fetch data at build time to serve you static pages.
There is however one issue I experienced today; which was fetching data from an api route within the project.

The fetching failed because localhost is not available at build time.

Which results in a `ECONNREFUSED` error

One way around this is to use `getServerSideProps`
