## 1. Dynamically setting classes in TailWind

Avoid using string concatenation to create classnames

### Why?

PurgeCSS wonâ€™t know to preserve those classes.

### Suggested way ðŸ˜Ž

Dynamically select complete classnames

```html
<div className="{{  error  ?  'text-red-600'  :  'text-green-600'  }}"></div>
```

As long as a class name appears in your template in its entirety, PurgeCSS will not remove it.

## 2. Generating Unix time in JS

`Date.now()`
Could come in handy in scenarios where you need an ID for rendered list of items
