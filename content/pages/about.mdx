# About My Garden ðŸŒ±

Welcome to my Digital Garden. This is an extension of [my portfolio](https://ineza.codes/).
The idea of a digital garden came after realising that I had no place to store useful information.

I wanted a website where I could;

- Write my thoughts or discoveries that are related to my coding journey.
- Save useful links/bookmarks that I (or someone else) might require at a later time
- Save useful tools I've come across in case I ever forget them
- Write documentation about the projects I've worked on.

My first step was opening [issue #122](https://github.com/inezabonte/inezabonte/issues/122) on my
portfolio's repo as I began researching on how I would make it possible.

My aim was to worry less about the look of the site but more about the content.
I first came across [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). I had no idea what it was used for,
I later came to learn it's used mostly to develop design systems and building components in an isolated
environment. Storybook is nice, but it's a bit too complex for what I was looking for.

After searching I came across [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) and [docz](https://www.docz.site/).
They are both static site generators that use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the content which is a plus.
The difference between the two is that Nextra is powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) while docz is powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
Docz having been around for a longer time has the advantage of being well known with more users and more features as well.
I however chose Nextra because I have been building with Next.js for a while and wasn't willing to
let it go just yet and also because of its simple look and easiness to setup.

Anyway, feel free to have a look around. Hope it inspires you to make something of your own ðŸ˜Š
